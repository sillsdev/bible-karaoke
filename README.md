### Running AVA Unit and Integration Tests

We use the [AVA Node.js test runner](https://github.com/avajs/ava). When testing a single code unit use a unit test. When testing more than one unit of code or if the test takes time to execute then use an integration test. By default, the commands below will NOT execute tests in watch mode. If changing branches you may have to clear out `*.spec.js` and `*.integration.js` files.

For unit tests run:

```sh
npm test
```

For integration tests run:

```sh
npm run integration
```

### Writing AVA Unit and Integration Tests

Unit tests are placed in a `<unit>.spec.ts` file alongside the `<unit>.ts` file under test. Integration tests are placed in a `*.integration.ts` file. Our project looks for compiled test files ending in `\*.spec.js` or `\*.integration.js` depending on what type of test is being run.
If a test is more complex with sample data and/or scenarios, a test folder can optionally be created with additional supporting files to keep things tidy.

### Debugging/Running the application

```sh
npm run electron-dev
```

### Debugging the Node Backend in VSCode

We provide a debugging configuration for VSCode (defined in `.vscode/launch.json`)

1. set a breakpoint in VSCode somewhere in the Node backend JS code (not front-end React code)
2. `npm run electron-dev` (the Node debugger listens on port 9229)
3. In VSCode, run the Debug Configuration named _Node Backend_. The VSCode status bar will turn orange when it is successfully attached to the debugger
4. Use the Bible Karaoke application - the application will pause when a breakpoint is hit in VSCode

### Debugging the React Frontend in VSCode

### Build and package the app manually for testing

```sh
# Windows:
npm run electron-pack-win
# Mac:
npm run electron-pack-mac
# Linux:
npm run electron-pack-linux
```

Build the app automatically for distribution:

- Push to a branch of the form `release/*`, e.g. `release/v0.3.5`, or `release/v0.3.5-rc1`.
- Look in the GitHub **Actions** tab for the build artifacts.

Releasing

1. Update the _version_ in your project's `package.json` file (e.g. _0.3.4_).
2. Run `npm i` to update `package-lock.json`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with changes in this release.
4. Commit these changes to your release branch as defined in the section above.
5. Tag your commit. Make sure your tag name's format is `v*.*.*`.
6. Create a new draft GitHub **Release**, ensure the following are included:
   - a _Tag version_, e.g. `v0.3.4`.
   - a copy of the change log.
   - the installer artifact from GitHub **Actions** tab as Assets (attached binary) will be added in step 7.
7. Push the tag then the commit to GitHub.

### Style Guides

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) with a pre-commit hook. If you use **VS Code**, install the recommended extensions from this repo and formatting will happen on save.
